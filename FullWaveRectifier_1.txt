*Measuring the peak voltage of the output wave for 1cycle by actually measuring 
*peak at node2 and node3 and subtracting them will give the peak of output

*Measuring the average voltage of the output wave for 1cycle by actually measuring 
*average at node2 and node3 and subtracting them will give the average of output
